### Introduction:

Building a program doesn’t require a lot of knowledge or skill. High school kids do it all the time. Young men and women in college launch billion-dollar businesses based on cobbling together a few lines of PHP or Ruby. Armies of young programmers in cubicle farms around the world trudge through massive requirement documents stored in colossal issue-tracking systems, willing their systems to "work" through sheer brute force.

Getting it right, however, is another matter entirely. Building software correctly is hard. It requires knowledge and skills that most young programmers simply don’t yet possess. Achieving this demands thought and insight, which many programmers don’t take the time to cultivate. It requires a level of discipline and commitment that most programmers never imagined they would need. Above all, it requires a passion for the craft and a desire to be truly professional.

When a system is properly designed and architected, it minimizes the need for human resources during development. Its changes come with minimal costs, and modifying one part doesn’t result in a cascading failure across the entire system, unlike poorly architected systems where touching one piece causes everything to break apart.

### conclusion:
He emphasized that if you want to code randomly without any knowledge or structure, even elementary school kids can do that. The difference between you and a high school student lies in your knowledge and insight, which are gained through reading books. In the long run, you will win the race, even if you move slowly.
