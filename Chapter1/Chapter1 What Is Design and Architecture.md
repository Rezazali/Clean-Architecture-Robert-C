### What are Design and Architecture?
<hr>

Over the years, there has been a lot of confusion about design and architecture.
What is design? What is architecture? What are the differences between the two?

To start, I emphasize that there is no difference between them. None at all.

The word "architecture" is often used in a context that refers to something high-level, distinct from low-level details, whereas "design" is more commonly associated with low-level structures and decisions. However, this distinction seems meaningless when you consider what a real-world architect does.

Think about the architect of my new house. Does the house have architecture? Of course, it does. And what does that architecture include? Well, it encompasses the overall shape of the house, its external appearance, façades, and the arrangement of spaces and rooms. But when I look at the diagrams my architect has prepared, I see a lot of low-level details. I can see every outlet and light switch.

In summary, I see all the little details that support the high-level decisions. I also see that these low-level details and high-level decisions are part of the overall design of the house.

The same is true in software design. Low-level details and high-level structures are all part of a single cohesive whole. They form a continuous unity that defines the shape of the system. You cannot have one without the other.

### What is the Goal?
And what is the goal of those decisions? What is the purpose of good software design?

That goal is nothing less than an idealized description:

The purpose of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the necessary system.

The quality of a design is simply measured by the effort required to meet the customer’s needs. If this effort is low and remains low throughout the system’s lifetime, the design is good. But if the effort increases with each new release, the design is bad. It’s that simple.

### The Dangers of Ignoring Architecture: A Case Study
To emphasize the importance of architecture, this chapter presents a case study from a real software company. While the company’s name is omitted for confidentiality reasons, the data provided paints a clear picture of the consequences of prioritizing immediate performance over architectural integrity:

#### Growth in the Number of Engineers
The study begins by showing a dramatic increase in the number of engineers at the company—a trend often perceived as a sign of success. This growth reflects the company’s boom and its investment in software development capabilities.

#### Decline in Productivity
However, a stark contrast emerges when the company’s productivity is examined over the same period, measured by lines of code written. Despite the rise in the number of developers, the rate of code production stagnates, indicating a fundamental problem.

#### Rising Costs
The most alarming reality is revealed in a graph showing the cost per line of code over time. This cost rises significantly, highlighting that the company is increasingly spending more for smaller outputs.

These figures reveal a troubling reality: despite an expanding development team, the company faces a sharp decline in productivity. Developers are working hard, but their progress is hindered by a problem beyond their control.

### The Root Cause: "Disorder"
This chapter identifies the root cause of the company’s problem: accumulated "disorder" in the codebase. This "disorder" refers to the technical debt accrued over time due to rushed decisions and a lack of architectural focus. As the system grows, this disorder becomes harder and more expensive to manage, consuming more time and resources from developers.

This "disorder" manifests in several ways:

1. Unnecessary Duplication: Code with similar functionality is repeated in multiple parts of the system, leading to inconsistencies and difficulty in implementing changes.
2. Frequent Integrations: Changes in one part of the system require updates in many other areas, resulting in time-consuming integration efforts.
3. Fear of Change: Developers hesitate to make changes because the codebase becomes increasingly fragile and interdependent.
This disorder creates a vicious cycle: as the codebase grows more complex, developers avoid making changes, which leads to further neglect of architectural principles and makes the system increasingly cumbersome.
